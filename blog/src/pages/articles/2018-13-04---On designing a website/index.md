There are different ways to approach this. You can of course just dive straight into the wilderness, or you can try to bring structure into the process. Especially if you are working with multiple people who want to bring their own ideas and choices into the design of the website.

## Before you start making an endless amount of mock-ups...
Before you actually start designing, take a few notes about the product or brand. Here are some questions to ask yourself (some of these only matter if you actually <i>redesign</i> a website):
- What logo are they using?
- What language does the brand speak? 
- What is the ultimate goal of the product or service?
- Is there a color scheme? 
- Are there any existing design rules (clean, playful, serious, elegant, ...)
- What is the current problem of the old website? Why are they in need of a relaunch?
- What are their business goals?
- What are their users like? What do they want to achieve?

After taking some notes and feeling less anxious you can then meet with your client and have a <strong>creative kick-off meeting</strong>. 

## A creative workshop to gather as much value as possible
Meeting with the client means meeting different stakeholders. This can include the marketing manager or the developers. To avoid having too many revisions and frustration and to get everyone on the same page, you will need to ask the right questions and maybe run a small workshop to collect more information on the product or service.


When I was researching this topic, I found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSx2wayTk0g">this video about UX Design</a> and it really enlightened me. We followed their advice and ran a so-called "Site Audit". 

Everyone was involved in this workshop - developers, marketing, business and creative people. 
We wrote five different subjects on sticky notes and described briefly what they meant. 

<b>Culture</b>: What are the brands or companies' cultural values?<br/>
<strong>Customer</strong>: What are the companies' customers or users like?<br/>
<strong>Voice</strong>: What language does the company want to speak? <br/>
<strong>Benefit</strong>: How does the product benefit the user? <br/>
<strong>Value</strong>: What makes this brand or company special? <br/>

Each participant jotted down their most important values to each subject. We then had a great foundation to start working on the designs and mock-ups for the website.

## Asking the right questions is key to satisfy the client 

More often than not, some of your clients share their ideas with you. And this is good because it can give you an easier start. If you feel the need to evaluate them, try asking the right questions to avoid confusion or double-check what their goal is. Some ideas:

- How did you come up with this idea?
- Describe how this looks in your mind?
- Why is this important?
- Why do you believe that to be true?
- Beyond money, why does this company exist? What are your values? 

## Starting the design process

Now, with so much information, there really isn't much that can go wrong. Of course, there are many other things that come into process. But this post only focuses on the actual start.

Another helpful life tip for designers: When you start designing, always communicate with your stakeholders. Show them progress and collect feedback.

But don't lose yourself in an endless feedback-loop. You need to differentiate and prioritize; you can always ask yourself the following question: "Does this kind of feedback help me complete the ultimate goal of the website?" and then move on.

Don't spend too much time on the graphical components. One day is best. Don't lose focus of the ultimate goal and the diagnosed problems to avoid losing too much time and to make your client happy.
