Hi there ðŸ’“my name is Theodora, or simply Theo. 

I study Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.h-da.com/" target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt, Germany</a> and work as a Front-End Developer. I started creating websites 12 years ago, when blinking gifs were all the rage. I love designing and coding things and enjoy reading about psychology, science and user experience.

In my freetime, I enjoy playing video games, doing yoga and practicing my creative skills such as painting and sketching. I love to share knowledge on design topics and frontend development. 

Currently, my skillset includes
- Angular
- ReactJS
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- CSS Frameworks
- Adobe Ai, Ps and Xd
- Iconography
- creating various illustrations
- basic understanding about databases & backend development
- some C++ and Java
